# End-to-End Machine Learning Project with Deep Learning and MLOps

## Overview

This project demonstrates the development and deployment of a machine learning model from scratch, leveraging deep learning techniques and modern MLOps tools. The goal is to provide a reproducible, scalable, and easily accessible solution for end to end machine learning tasks, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and maintenance.

The project encompasses the entire lifecycle of a machine learning application, including data preprocessing, model development, experiment tracking, deployment via a secure API, and a user-friendly interface. Containerization with Docker ensures reproducibility, and the architecture is designed with scalability in mind.

## Key Features

* **Deep Learning Models:** Utilizes either Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow or PyTorch.
* **Automated Data Pipeline:** Implements an automated data pipeline using DVC (Data Version Control) for managing data and preprocessing steps.
* **Experiment Tracking:** Leverages MLflow for tracking experiments, comparing model performance, and managing model artifacts.
* **Containerized Architecture:** All components (MLflow, preprocessing, hyperparameter search, training, API, Streamlit) are containerized using Docker for easy setup and reproducibility.
* **Secure API:** Provides a secure API (built with Flask or FastAPI) to interact with the deployed model.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers a graphical user interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction with the model.
* **Monitoring:** Includes integration points for monitoring model performance and data drift (probably using Weights & Biases or Grafana, not decided yet).
* **Reproducibility:** Emphasizes reproducibility through the use of Docker for environment encapsulation and DVC for data and pipeline management.
* **Scalability:** The modular, containerized architecture allows for easier scaling of individual components.

## Architecture

The project is structured into several Docker containers, each responsible for a specific stage of the pipeline:

1.  **`mlflow`:** Hosts the MLflow tracking server for managing experiments and models.
2.  **`preprocess`:** Contains the logic for data preprocessing and splitting.
3.  **`hypersearch`:** Responsible for searching for the optimal hyperparameters for the model.
4.  **`training`:** Executes the model training process using the prepared data and chosen hyperparameters.
5.  **`monitoring`:** Monitor the model.
6.  **`api`:** Serves the trained model through a secure API endpoint.
7.  **`streamlit`:** Provides the user interface for interacting with the deployed model via the API.

These containers are orchestrated using Docker Compose. DVC manages the data flow and execution of the preprocessing, hyperparameter search and training stages.

## Reproducibility

This project prioritizes reproducibility through:

**Docker:** Ensures that all components run in isolated and consistent environments with defined dependencies.

**DVC:** Tracks the data, code, and intermediate outputs of the machine learning pipeline, allowing you to reproduce specific versions of your model and results.

## Scalability

The containerized architecture allows for easier scaling of individual components based on demand.

For example, you can scale the API service horizontally by running multiple instances of the api container behind a load balancer (using tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm in a production environment). Similarly, resource-intensive tasks like training or hyperparameter search can be scaled by allocating more resources to their respective containers or by distributing the workload across multiple containers.
