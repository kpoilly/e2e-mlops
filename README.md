# AI-Powered Music Recommendation from Images (End-to-End MLOps Project)

## Overview

This is an ambitious project to build an end-to-end music recommendation system where users can submit an image and receive a relevant song suggestion to serve as a "soundtrack" for that image. This project emphasizes the application of modern MLOps principles to ensure the reproducibility, scalability, and maintainability of the solution.

The goal is to cover the entire lifecycle of a Machine Learning application: from music data collection and processing to training (or utilizing) Deep Learning models for image analysis and recommendation, experiment tracking, API deployment, monitoring, and a simple user interface.

## The Idea

The user uploads an image. The system analyzes this image to extract its mood, objects, colors, potential era, etc. Based on this analysis, a song whose atmosphere and characteristics match those of the image is recommended, with the option to listen to a preview.

## Key Features & MLOps Architecture

*   **Complete MLOps Pipeline:** From data ingestion to monitored deployment.
*   **Multimodal AI:** Utilization of Vision models (like CLIP) to understand images and Language Models (LLMs, e.g., via Mistral API) for semantic information extraction and tagging.
*   **Deep Learning Approach:**
    *   Image embedding extraction (CLIP).
    *   Semantic tag generation from images (LLM).
    *   Feature engineering for music data (Spotify metadata, lyrics analysis).
    *   (Potentially) Training a dedicated matching model to refine recommendations.
*   **Automated Data Pipeline (Apache Airflow):** For periodic collection and updating of music data (e.g., new Spotify releases), lyrics analysis, and music embedding generation.
*   **Experiment Tracking & Model Management (MLflow):** To track experiments, version models (if fine-tuning or custom training), and manage their lifecycle.
*   **Containerized Architecture (Docker & Docker Compose):** All services (API, image processing, recommendation, MLOps tools) will be containerized for portability and reproducibility. Migration to Kubernetes (Minikube/k3s locally) may be considered.
*   **Access API (FastAPI):** To expose the recommendation functionality.
*   **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):** For automating tests, Docker image builds, and deployments.
*   **Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana):** To monitor service performance and, potentially, recommendation relevance.
*   **C++ Optimization:** For inference components criticals in terms of latency.

## Project Structure & Architecture

The project will be organized with a clear directory structure to separate concerns and facilitate development. The core services will be containerized and orchestrated, interacting via APIs.

### Conceptual System Architecture

The system will comprise several communicating services:

1.  **User Frontend:** Simple interface for image uploads and displaying recommendations.
2.  **API Gateway (Nginx):** Single entry point for requests.
3.  **Backend Services:**
    *   **Main API Service:** Orchestrates internal calls.
    *   **Image Analysis Service:** Uses CLIP for embeddings.
    *   **Semantic Tagging Service:** Uses an LLM to extract tags and attributes from the image.
    *   **Music Data Access Service:** Interfaces with the song database.
    *   **Recommendation Service:** Matching logic (embedding similarity, tag filtering, matching model).
4.  **Databases:**
    *   **Relational Database (PostgreSQL):** For song metadata.
    *   **Vector Database (pgvector/FAISS):** For storing and searching image and music embeddings.
